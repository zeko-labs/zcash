## Project Summary

```text
IronLimb brings private application logic and programmability to the Zcash ecosystem through Zeko, using Ethereum for proof settlement and financial-asset connectivity. It will deliver a shielded-ZEC testnet bridge, confidential ZEC/ETH trading, reusable verification infrastructure, and a separately gated local prototype of Zcash-enforced redemption.
```

## Project Description

```text
IronLimb extends ZEC's utility into private financial applications: logic executes on Zeko, with proofs settled through Ethereum. The first deliverable is a working shielded-ZEC testnet bridge, followed by proof-bound issuance and confidential ZEC/ETH trading. We request $400,000 over 45 weeks for that software, reusable verification components, and a local prototype of Zcash-enforced redemption. The schedule preserves fourteen weeks for consensus integration and reverse-state authentication, followed by eight weeks for independent review, remediation, and verification. Gates 2 and 3 ship a usable testnet bridge and proof-enforced confidential exchange; the grant funds software delivery alongside the gated consensus research. The shared accounting, authenticated-state, and recovery components connect these deliverables, with independent acceptance and payment at each gate.

The architecture combines complementary capabilities. Zcash provides shielded ZEC and cryptographic foundations compatible with Zeko's Pasta-based Kimchi/Pickles stack. Zeko provides programmable execution and recursive application proofs. We choose Ethereum for its established proof-verification and contract-enforced settlement infrastructure, developer tooling, and connectivity to financial assets and applications. The grant will measure the cross-verification advantage of the shared cryptography.

This is a practical route to private applications for Zcash users while Zcash-native programmability and redemption mechanisms continue to develop. Ethereum's base ledger is transparent by default; IronLimb implements confidential application state and exchange logic rather than assuming privacy from settlement. The initial exchange adapts Zeko's existing private order book for confidential ZEC/ETH trading. Access to other Ethereum DeFi protocols requires additional integrations and liquidity, beyond the baseline deliverable.

IronLimb is an application and interoperability project built around Zcash's existing Ironwood pool. Testnet reserves remain threshold-controlled, and Ethereum settlement does not remove that native custody dependence. Gate 4 investigates Zcash enforcing withdrawals from authenticated, accepted Zeko state on a local network. Production adoption remains separate, and the deployment's data-availability, administrative, and exit assumptions will be disclosed.
```

## Proposed Problem

```text
ZEC holders should be able to use programmable financial applications without exposing their balances and trading activity. Shielded Zcash protects native transfers, while Ethereum provides a developed environment for financial applications and proof settlement; connecting those capabilities requires private application execution and a sound cross-chain custody design.

A payment proof alone cannot compel a reserve signer to redeem ZEC, and Ethereum settlement alone cannot make application activity confidential. Builders need authenticated chain state, duplicate-resistant issuance, confidential asset accounting, and enforceable native-redemption rules. IronLimb develops these components together and publishes them for reuse beyond its initial exchange.
```

## Proposed Solution

```text
We will connect shielded ZEC to private Zeko applications with Ethereum settlement through five delivery gates:

1. Specify both verification directions, benchmark candidate constructions, and establish continuation criteria.
2. Ship an attested/threshold testnet bridge with deposits, withdrawals, refunds, and 10 external testers.
3. Enforce proof-bound issuance and demonstrate atomic confidential ZEC/ETH order-book settlement.
4. Prototype Zcash-enforced escrow, liability migration, and recovery on an isolated local network.
5. Complete independent review, remediation, reproducible release, and a production-dependency decision.

Gate 2 establishes the bridge integration and operational workflows reused by Gate 3, which enforces proof-bound issuance and confidential exchange rules. Native custody remains threshold-controlled until consensus rules actually govern release; verifier rotation alone cannot change that.
```

## Solution Format

```text
MIT-licensed original code, public specifications, benchmark harnesses, reference fixtures, a testnet bridge, confidential order-book application, local consensus prototype, integration guides, and external review/remediation reports.

Repositories include CONTRIBUTING.md, reproducible setup, CI, and monthly forum updates. Existing dependencies retain their licenses. The three supporting documents cover technical design, delivery/budget/continuity, and cryptographic fit.
```

## Dependencies

```text
The implementation depends on Zebra and current Ironwood libraries/rules, o1js and Kimchi/Pickles, Zeko execution interfaces, Ethereum settlement contracts, and the selected proof adapters. Any SP1 receipt relied upon by issuance must be enforced in the acceptance path. The testnet requires custody signers and proving resources. External DeFi integrations and liquidity are separate dependencies, not automatic consequences of Ethereum settlement.

Zeko is a network dependency as well as a code dependency. We will record deployment identity, roles, verifier mode, and DA signers, retain an independently reproducible stack, and test restoration. If upstream support or Sepolia changes, affected deposits pause; resumption requires revalidation or an explicitly identified replacement test deployment. No silent balance migration or network substitution is allowed.

Martin leads technical work. An external security reviewer will be selected from qualified existing relationships or Zcash-community-recommended specialists, subject to availability, an agreed scope, and a quote. No engagement or community endorsement is represented as confirmed. Intended-user validation is separate: integrating Zeko builders, external testnet users, and a Zcash protocol reviewer or technical delegate for consensus work; individuals remain to be confirmed. Mainnet Zcash-enforced custody also requires consensus adoption; the local prototype does not assume it. No upstream endorsement or merge is claimed.
```

## Technical Approach

```text
IronLimb reuses Ironwood and Kimchi/o1js implementations, adding verifier and application constraints rather than a new proof system. Gate 1 compares full bundle verification (A) with note-opening/inclusion under authenticated state (B). The following are proposed security requirements, not implemented results.

Deposit statement:
1. The qualifying commitment is included under an authenticated anchor in accepted canonical Zcash history.
2. Its opening binds the amount and designated custody recipient.
3. The resulting private credit belongs to the authorized Zeko recipient.
4. The deposit cannot be credited twice, including across retries and upgrades; uniqueness must meet the declared leakage target.
5. Network, pool, bridge instance, protocol version, and verification key are bound into acceptance.
6. Any required encrypted-note delivery or memo binding is checked.

Redemption statement (Gate 4's proposed consensus path):
1. The checkpoint is canonical Ethereum-accepted Zeko state under the specified finality and deployment rules; an unrelated valid history is insufficient.
2. The withdrawal follows that state and is authorized by the claim holder.
3. The claim cannot be redeemed twice, traded while pending, or both refunded and paid.
4. Authorization binds the exact Zcash transaction effects, including recipient, amount, and fees.
5. Release preserves reserve/liability accounting and the specified remaining escrow state.
6. Zcash enforces the selected release/recovery rules and domain bindings, without an undisclosed signer bypass.

Worked example (Gate 3 testnet; fees omitted):
Alice deposits 10 test ZEC to the threshold-controlled Zcash reserve and receives 10 private zkZEC claims after proof-verified acceptance. ZEC stays on Zcash; the claims live on Zeko. She atomically trades 4 zkZEC for a maker's agreed zkETH amount, leaving her 6 zkZEC and the maker 4. Both parties authorize the terms; the matcher may learn them, and a sequencer can censor submission. The native reserve still holds 10 ZEC. Alice requests redemption of her remaining 6; those claims become unavailable for trading. Reserve signers pay her Zcash recipient, then the claims are finalized against authenticated payout confirmation. The remaining 4 ZEC backs the maker's claims. The custody threshold can steal reserves or refuse payment despite correct proofs; the ETH leg has separate bridge assumptions. Gate 4 researches replacing signer discretion with enforceable release rules.

Gate 1 benchmark questions:
- What are A/B constraint counts, proving time, peak memory, proof size, and verification costs on named hardware?
- What does canonical Zcash authentication cost, including difficulty, upgrades, reorganizations, and anchor freshness?
- Which transcript, encoding, field-arithmetic, and recursion adapters are required?
- Which uniqueness construction prevents repeat credit, what secrets does it require, and what linkage survives rotation or reserve spending?
- How can Zcash authenticate canonical Ethereum-accepted checkpoints, and what are the complete finality-verification/adapter costs?
- Does each complete acceptance path fit precommitted resource ceilings with real proofs, exact public outputs, and adversarial fixtures?

An infeasible reverse-authentication path blocks continuation unless an amended scope is approved. Signed roots, guest execution alone, and mock acceptance cannot satisfy proof-verified gates. Gate 4 uses an isolated local Zebra branch; public activation is separate.

We will adapt Zeko's private order book, demonstrated on Sepolia, for confidential zkZEC/zkETH trading, reducing implementation risk. New work adds proof-bound ZEC issuance, encrypted-note accounting, and atomic settlement, enforcing authorization, conservation, nullifier checks, limit prices, expiry, cancellation, and replay protection while allowing partial fills and preventing overfills. We measure public, operator, matcher, and network leakage and test encrypted-note recovery. The UI discloses threshold custody, verifier mode, and administrative powers. Migration requires reserve reconciliation; commitments and OP_RETURN anchors establish neither data availability nor enforced custody.

The technical design contains branch-neutral relation sketches, accounting transitions, and validation order. Mina shares the proof foundations; Zeko supplies the selected Ethereum-connected execution path. The alternatives document compares Mina, Ztarknet, and Aztec without unmeasured speed or uniqueness claims.
```

## Upstream Merge Opportunities

```text
Candidate Zcash contributions include Ironwood fixtures, validation/tooling improvements, and a local Zebra research branch. A concrete extension proposal can follow the ZIP process if results justify it. o1Labs/Zeko contributions may include verifier components, differential fixtures, and adapters in the appropriate language and repository.

Seek maintainer feedback at Gate 1 and submit small reviewable changes as ready. Upstream contribution requirements apply. Delivery does not depend on a merge, endorsement, or mainnet activation.

## Hardware/Software Costs (USD)

```text
$40,500
```

## Hardware/Software Justification

```text
Planning caps: $20,000 for CPU/GPU proving; $14,000 for isolated nodes, test environments, and CI (including $4,000 of startup infrastructure); $6,500 for storage, backups, and observability. Total: $40,500. Track usage and refine allocations from Gate 1 measurements. No liquidity or trading capital is included.
```

## Service Costs (USD)

```text
$60,000
```

## Service Costs Justification

```text
Planning caps: $50,000 for independent review of a named circuit/accounting/custody/recovery scope and remediation verification; $10,000 for external integration, reproducibility, and leakage testing. Total: $60,000. An external reviewer will be selected from qualified existing partners or Zcash-community-recommended specialists through a scoped engagement and quote; no firm is represented as committed. Review scope is published; this amount does not imply a comprehensive production audit.
```

## Compensation Costs (USD)

```text
$299,500
```

## Compensation Costs Justification

```text
ZK implementation/circuit lead: $2,750/week × 36 = $99,000.
SP1/protocol engineer: $2,750/week × 24 = $66,000.
Zeko engineer: $2,750/week × 30 = $82,500.
Protocol reviewer: $2,750/week × 15 = $41,250.
Documentation/specification and startup coordination: $10,750, approximately 3.91 person-weeks at $2,750/week, including $1,000 startup compensation.
Total: $299,500; approximately 108.91 person-weeks and 2.42 FTE over 45 weeks. Effort is calculated from compensation divided by the planning rate and rounded; the $1,000 startup compensation is included, not additional. We use one internal planning rate of $2,750 per 40-hour person-week ($68.75/hour) for all workstreams. It prices pooled team capacity rather than asserting that each contributor receives the same salary; it is not a confirmed individual salary or vendor quote. The allocation covers both verification directions, authenticated-state integration, confidential exchange, recovery, and remediation. Martin leads delivery; Martin will manage individual assignments and available capacity against the funded milestones. External review is separately budgeted; milestone payments include all categories.
```

## Total Budget (USD)

```text
$400,000
```

## Previous Funding

```text
No
```

## Previous Funding Details

```text
N/A. We have not received previous funding from Zcash Community Grants.
```

## Other Funding Sources

```text
Yes
```

## Other Funding Sources Details

```text
Zeko Labs’ existing platform has been supported by company and investor funding. No other funding has been received or is planned for IronLimb.

This request funds new Zcash-specific verification, integration, confidential exchange, and native-redemption research. Existing Zeko code and prior audits are background resources, not grant-funded deliverables. Grant costs will be tracked separately and will not duplicate costs funded elsewhere.
```

## Implementation Risks

```text
Proof cost or chain-authentication errors could prevent safe issuance; Gate 1 measures the routes and rejects an infeasible design. Threshold collusion or unavailability remains a native custody risk until consensus enforcement. Bugs or leakage in the note pool can break privacy/accounting; differential and adversarial tests precede review.

Ethereum settlement verifies the encoded state-transition rules; it does not certify application correctness, make data available by itself, or remove administrative powers. Network support, Sepolia changes, and DA membership can interrupt service. The continuity plan requires backups, independent deployment/recovery exercises, deposit pauses, and explicit revalidation. It does not promise liveness after all operators disappear.

Authenticating canonical Ethereum-accepted Zeko state may require substantial additional proof and consensus work; it is a separately costed Gate 1 feasibility dependency and can block continuation. Zcash-enforced redemption may remain impractical or unadopted. Gate 4 delivers a local research prototype, not public activation. Prior core audits do not cover IronLimb.

Gate 1 failure stops downstream work; Gate 2 failure stops exchange integration; Gate 3 failure stops consensus integration; Gate 4 failure blocks a production recommendation. A negative research result can complete Gate 1, but cannot replace undelivered later software or authorize spending on another product. Material scope changes require an agreed grant amendment.
```

## Potential Side Effects

```text
Users may confuse proof-verified issuance with trustless custody or confidential trading with boundary unlinkability. UI disclosures separate those guarantees and identify matcher/timing/network leakage. Fixed denominations and batching are mitigations, not anonymity proofs.

ETH adds separate bridge and issuer/asset-mapping assumptions. Unsupported legacy claims cannot become certified backing through a verifier change. Test assets and deployment identities remain explicit. Local consensus code stays isolated; no mainnet user funds or public consensus changes are completion metrics.
```

## Success Metrics

```text
- Reproducible candidate-verifier costs and a reviewed Gate 1 continuation decision.
- A working threshold-custody testnet round trip completed by at least 10 external testers.
- Real proof-bound issuance under authenticated state; invalid proof, duplicate claim, wrong recipient/domain, and reorganization fixtures rejected.
- Atomic confidential ZEC/ETH order-book settlement supports partial fills; unauthorized fills, expired or cancelled orders, limit-price violations, overfills, and one-sided settlement are rejected.
- An intended-user representative reproduces the worked example from a clean deployment: deposit 10 test ZEC, trade 4 zkZEC for agreed zkETH, redeem the remaining 6, and reconcile claims and reserves against the documented fixture, with fees funded and recorded separately.
- Published proving and leakage results for public, operator, matcher, and network observers.
- A reproducible local escrow/migration/recovery prototype and explicit outcomes for censorship, shutdown, and missing data.
- Independent review, remediation evidence, integration documentation, and a versioned release.

Intended-user representatives or delegates validate each milestone using published commands and workflows. Confirm their identities before work starts; authors alone do not accept their own deliverables. Post monthly progress and milestone evidence to the forum.
```

## Startup Funding (USD)

```text
$5,000
```

## Startup Funding Justification

```text
Startup totals $5,000: $4,000 hardware/software for repository/CI infrastructure and reproducible environments; $1,000 compensation for dependency inventory and reviewer/validator scheduling (approximately 0.36 person-weeks at $2,750/week); $0 external services. These amounts are included in the category totals and $400,000 request, not added to them. Startup plus all milestone payments equals the total; no liquidity or mainnet launch expense is added.
